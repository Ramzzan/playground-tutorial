/**
We have an Animal class that only has a name property. Then, we create a dog object and create cat object but assign dog to the cat object.

Since they are reference type objects, they are pointing to the same memory address, so they are actually the same objects!
If we change one of their property, other one will be affected as well because they are pointing to the same address. Letâ€™s take a look below.
